# Greetings

## Greet someone a Happy New Year!

### Customizing the Greeting

You can customize the greeting by adding query parameters to the URL:

- `from`: The name of the person sending the greeting.
- `link`: A URL to link the sender's name to.

Example:

```
http://greetingsfrom.rickyadriell.com?from=John&link=https://example.com
```

This will display "Happy New Year!" with a link to "John" that points to `https://example.com`.
